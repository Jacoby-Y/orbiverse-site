# The Origin Story

About 5 years ago, I (Jacoby, founder of Orbiverse) wanted to learn how to code so I could make games. After a year or so of trial and error, I eventually learned enough Unity to make a few starter projects. Eventually I wanted to get into making games using web technologies, so I made <a target="_blank" href="https://topazplayz.itch.io/pen-factori">Pen Factori</a>.

The idea of making idle web games just clicked in my brain, so I started making more and got a lot better at UI/UX and coding in the process. Most of the games I worked on I ended up quitting halfway through because I was getting sick of working on it, getting better at coding, then having to replace my previously written, horrible code. So, I would just start on the next project.

Eventually, after making games with my own JS frameworks, I decided to switch over to <a target="_blank" href="https://svelte.dev">Svelte</a> and make my first game with it: <a target="_blank" href="https://orbiverse.itch.io/wizardry-and-ichor">Wizardry and Ichor</a>. 
Actually, since then I haven't looked back. I've been making all my games using Svelte as their foundation.

At some point I got tired of making basic GUI games. I wanted something with moving parts! So, I cobbled together some graphics using the built in Canvas renderer, and made <a target="_blank" href="https://orbiverse.itch.io/idle-orbs">Idle Orbs</a>. From that seed, all other Idle Orbs games were born and it's been a huge part of my life since.

These days, game development is bit more modernized. I have my own <a target="_blank" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/cobys-epic-engine">engine</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/cobys-epic-ecs">ECS</a>, rendering using WebGL (with <a target="_blank" href="https://pixijs.com/">PixiJS</a>) instead of the default Canvas rendering.

(PS: I wouldn't recommend using my NPM packages... they're not ready for the public yet)

# What's Next?

As of writing this, I'm almost done with *Idle Orbs: Remastered*. After that I have more plans to get a mobile game out eventually.

As for what's next for the general future of "Orbiverse"... I'm not sure. It'd be awesome if I could make enough to live off of my games and maybe even hire some help. But, in the meantime, I'll just keep up the work and make games!
